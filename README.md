# COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Hesitancy in Low and Middle Income Countries

Replication for the paper relies on three files:

`paper.Rmd` compiles the paper in a PDF `paper.pdf`. It calls some or all of:

`1_cleaning.Rmd` cleans and prepares data for analysis (not called on public repo as it requires raw country files).

`2_tables.Rmd` creates figures and tables included in the paper and other diagnostics.

`3_main_text.Rmd` text, referencing figures and tables generated by `2_tables.Rmd`


Data and auxiliary files to reproduce the paper are contained in the folders:

`/1_country_data` [not in public version] contains individual folder for each study with a data file and relevant documentation (if available).

`/2_input_data` contains auxiliary data files for the analysis:

- `dictionary.xlsx`: an Excel file with variable names and labels
- `studies_info.xlsx`: an Excel file with details for each study, including sampling methodology, question wording, and recoding categories
- `wgm_2018_publiccsv.csv`: a csv with data from the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 study
- `WHO_coverage_estimates_series.xls`: an Excel file with data from the World Health Organization about vaccine incidence

`/3_rep_data` stores data files generated by `1_cleaning.Rmd`.

`/4_files` contains files to permit the PDF compilation.

Figures included in the paper are generated automatically during the compilation process and stored in `/paper_files/figurelatex`.
