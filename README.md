`2_tables.Rmd` creates figures and tables included in the paper and other diagnostics.

`3_paper.Rmd` compiles the paper in a PDF `paper.pdf`.

Data and auxiliary files to reproduce the paper are contained in the folders:

`/1_input_data` contains auxiliary data files for the analysis:

- `dictionary.xlsx`: an Excel file with variable names and labels
- `studies_info.xlsx`: an Excel file with details for each study, including sampling methodology, question wording, and recoding categories
- `wgm_2018_publiccsv.csv`: a csv with data from the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 study
- `WHO_coverage_estimates_series.xls`: an Excel file with data from the World Health Organization about vaccine incidence

`/2_rep_data` stores data files generated by `1_cleaning.Rmd`.

`/3_country_data` contains individual folder for each study with a data file and relevant documentation (if available).

`/4_paper_supplementary_files` contains files to permit the PDF compilation.

Figures included in the paper are generated automatically in the compilation process and stored in `/paper_files/figurelatex`.
